## Style Guidelines

Needless to say, cohesion calls for a unified style.[^1] However, I haven't thought of anything yet on this regard.

- [ ] Decide on some basic style guidelines. ⏫ ➕ 2024-06-01

## Requests & [[Tasks]]

### Requests

If you have some request, add a [[Tasks|task]]:

- [ ] This is a task ➕ 2024-06-01
- [ ] Install the '[[Tasks]]' community plugin[^2]
- [ ] Access the command palette (Ribbonon LHS, or 'Ctrl+P' on Windows, or 'Cmd+P' on Mac).
- [ ] Type 'Task'
- [ ] Create a new task with the desired details.
- [ ] To mark a [[Tasks|task]] as completed, just click on the checkbox.

Furthermore,
- [ ] One a task is complete put it between double percentage signs (%); e.g., %% 'the task' %% . This way they will not be visible in read mode, nor 'Publish'. ➕ 2024-06-03

### Tasks

There are [[Tasks|tasks]] embedded in the notes, representing changes, and/or additions that need to be made; furthermore, there is a note[^3] ([[Tasks]]), where all tasks get compiled[^4], classified by different of their characteristics. If you feel like contributing but don't know what to do, and have the free time, check them in case you can help.

[^1]: This is not a dictatorship... yet. In other words, I don't care enough to check.
[^2]: This is the [Obsidian plugin link](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-tasks-plugin), and the [plugin's dedicate webpage](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction).




[^3]: This note, [[Tasks]] cannot be published because queries do not get compiled properly in 'Publish', for now. Therefore, it would be useless, since people would only see the query code.
[^4]: It's automated, if you create a new task you don't need to worry about whether or not you have to also add it to [[Tasks]], and under which category to do so.
